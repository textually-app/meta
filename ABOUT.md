# About Textually[^1]

Textually is a purely textual dating app (or website)[^2]. It has a
handful of goals:

1.  To encourage you to be as authentic and honest as possible about who
    you are and what you want
2.  To de-emphasise visual attraction at the outset, to focus a bit on
    these deeper things
3.  (And through this) To facilitate deeper, more meaningful connections
    (than swiping doctored selfies)
4.  To guide you to be mindful through this entire process

To enable this, your profile on the app is essentially just two text
fields:

1.  Who you are
2.  What you're looking for

You have a lot of room to breathe in this format, to describe all sorts
of things that aren't easily captured in standard app forms with
pre-selected fields or simple question prompts. Of course, I understand
that physical attraction is important and so we'll have an escape valve
(e.g. linking to Instagram or an externally hosted album) as a way to
accommodate for this.

To avoid the problem of needing to look through potentially stale and
repetitively surfaced profiles, profiles are not the thing that is being
surfaced in the app to other people. Instead, you are prompted to post
an ad for what you want which goes into a central feed. People will get
to see this feed (possibly filtered by some really basic things like
proximity or sexuality). If they find your ad interesting, they can tap
through to your profile, and if interested, can message you.

There are no arbitrary limits on who can post with what frequency, or
who can message who first or how many times or whatever, because the
entire experience operates with only one rule. **And this is to be
kind.** This is ruthlessly enforced, and anyone found not conforming is
booted. Additionally, you can be anonymous (in the sense of using a
pseudonym) to other people, but you need to be properly verified (as an
actual person) before being allowed to post.[^3]

It's my expectation (much like on Twitter or Reddit) that people will
make up their own syntax when talking about certain things (e.g. M4F for
Man looking for a woman or CF for child-free), and this will allow
Textually to go from blobs of text to more structured data. This is how
the feed can be kept pertinent and interesting.

## Some refinements to concepts as I share it with others

There are some hard criteria that most people will not budge on, e.g.
whether they want to have kids, whether they are ok with the other
person having kids, gender they are looking for, religion, their
sexuality, political views, proximity, ...

So when I imagine my ideal app, I feel that it should:

- Have a lot of genuine people, ones that are actually willing to try.
- Allow you to filter them by the hard lines mentioned previously.
- Amongst these filtered people, you should get a deep sense (mostly in
words) of
- Who they are
- What they feel they're looking for in the long term
- What are they are practically looking for right now

To facilitate this, there could be:
- Pre-screening of people
- Prompts for reflection activities, e.g. Like every couple day or
number of matches, you get some kind of reflection prompt or activity,
that makes you think about what you want/intentions/deal breakers
- Prompts during actual messaging: e.g. Prompting you to share a secret

Hopefully, all of this provides a holistic experience that prompts you
to always have your most authentic self ready on display. And it's the
dynamic nature of this that keeps things relevant and interesting.

Think of incorporating questionnaires following Tessa West's work.

[^1]: A legitimate word, but also a portmanteu or textual and sexually.
[^2]: Henceforth the word *app* just means mobile app or website.
[^3]: I'm alternatively toying with the idea that only referred people
      can sign up, hoping that existing social pressure will lead to good
      behaviour (and discourage bad behaviour like ghosting)

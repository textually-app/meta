# The Textually Community

[Textually][textually-about] is an inclusive and predominantly
text-based dating app that I am starting to sketch out. The app
experience encourages you to be as authentic and honest as possible
about who you are and what you want. To get a better sense of my
initial ideas for Textually, please read [more about the
app][textually-about].

This is the place where we discuss [ideas for building
Textually][textually-ideas], as well as coming up with guidelines to
foster the ideal community.

If you find this interesting or have related ideas, please [talk to
me][harish-contact]. I‚Äôd love to collaborate on this. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è

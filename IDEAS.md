# Ideas for prototyping Textually

Upon some reflection, I’ve been realising that a slightly customised
Mastodon instance would serve as a good prototype to experiment with
the [core ideas underlying Textually][textually-about].

If you had a Mastadon instance with:

- richer profiles that get at who you are and what you’re looking for
- a streamlined theme that fit the tone of the site
- strong community guidelines and norms (e.g. using tags and authentic
  IDs)
- possibly even single-sign-on to something like Signal for genuine
  encrypted conversations

You’re probably in a good place to:

- establish progressive disclosure of profile information as your
  relationships grow
- have timelines that enrich relationships (few and deep) instead of
  cheapening them

In mechanical terms, I imagine the flow to be something like this:

1. You “prove” who you are, self-attest to being kind and sign up.
2. You maintain a rich profile that is guided by the app.
3. You post about what you want with good tags.
4. People login and follow the main (local timeline) feed and filter
   (or search) appropriately by tags.
5. If someone’s writing is interesting, you click/tap through their
   profile and message them.
6. If someone’s writing is really interesting, it has the possibility
   of being shared with the wider fediverse, expanding the rach of the
   ad.
